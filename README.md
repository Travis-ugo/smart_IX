## About Smart Ix.
the smart Ix is a home automation assistance that lets you control a large family of devices across your home. The smart Ix application gives the ability to automate activities of your smart home devices by setting up a routine, routines allow you set up commands for your smart home devices which can be triggered by an action or time set for its execution. Setting up scenes to execute a common activity at the same time, the scene allows executing multiple commands at the same time without having to reorder your smart devices.
the smart Ix mobile applications are built with flutter.



## Getting Started with flutter

The smart Ix applications are built with flutter, so installing the flutter SDK on your machine is a must.
Depending on the machine to be installed, flutter provides different versions of the SDK to suit your preferred operating system. 
check out the link for more information regarding the installation of flutter in your machine.

### A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development and Firebase for flutter, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/),  [https://firebase.flutter.dev/]  which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


### state management.

the smart ix application implant the bloc pattern as its state management tool, 
Flutter bloc is state management for flutter applications, used to manage and handle all possible states of the application in an easy, 
and more readable way.


### Key concepts:

#### BlocProvider:
  is a Flutter widget that provides a bloc to its children viaÂ BlocProvider.of<T>(context). 
It is used as dependency injection (DI) widget so that a single instance of a bloc can be provided to multiple widgets within a subtree.

#### MultiBlocProvider:
  is a Flutter widget that merges multipleÂ BlocProviderÂ widgets into one.Â MultiBlocProviderÂ improves readability and eliminates the need to nest multipleÂ BlocProviders. By usingÂ MultiBlocProviderÂ we can go from:

#### RepositoryProvider:
  is a Flutter widget that provides a repository to its children viaÂ RepositoryProvider.of<T>(context). It is used as dependency injection (DI) widget so that a single instance of a repository can be provided to multiple widgets within a subtree.Â BlocProviderÂ should be used to provide blocs whereasÂ RepositoryProviderÂ should only be used for repositories.

#### BlocBuilder:
  is a Flutter widget that requires aÂ BlocÂ and aÂ builderÂ function.Â BlocBuilderÂ handles building the widget in response to new states.Â BlocBuilderÂ is very similar toÂ StreamBuilderÂ but has a more simple API to reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed. TheÂ builderÂ function will potentially be called many times and should be aÂ pure functionÂ that returns a widget in response to the state.

#### BlocListener:
  is a Flutter widget that takes aÂ BlocWidgetListenerÂ and an optionalÂ BlocÂ and invokes theÂ listenerÂ in response to state changes in the bloc. It should be used for functionality that needs to occur once per state change such as navigation, showing aÂ SnackBar, showing aÂ Dialog, etc

the smart ix applications implements bloc and cubit as state management tools interchangeably, here is the difference between both.

#### Cubit
One of the biggest advantages of usingÂ CubitÂ is simplicity. When creating aÂ Cubit, we only have to define the state as well as the functions which we want to expose to change the state. In comparison, when creating aÂ Bloc, we have to define the states, events, and Â EventHandlerÂ implementation. This makesÂ CubitÂ easier to understand and there is less code involved.

#### Bloc
One of the biggest advantages of usingÂ BlocÂ is knowing the sequence of state changes as well as exactly what triggered those changes. For a state that is critical to the functionality of an application, it might be very beneficial to use a more event-driven approach in order to capture all events in addition to state changes.
